  title: "Parallel queries with PostgreSQL"
  description: "This talk is an overview on Parallel Queries, introduced in the latest
release of PostgreSQL.

This feature is still being developed, and new capabilities will be
added in the next releases. Nevertheless, the current implementation
is already rather useful, and we will show realistic examples running
on PostgreSQL 10 (which will probably be already released by the time of PGDay).

We will also describe the architecture of Parallel Queries, the new
node types introduced, and how parallel aggregates work. This will
lead to a discussion on which kinds of queries can benefit more from
this feature."
