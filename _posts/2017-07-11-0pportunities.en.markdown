[EuroPython](https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/) is a fantastic European and evolving event dedicated to [Python](https://www.python.org/).
The 2017 edition is taking place in Rimini.

Everyone knows that [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) have a lot in common and often go hand in hand.

Why we are talking about [EuroPython](https://ep2017.europython.eu/en/) in [PGDay.IT's blog](http://2017.pgday.it/en/blog/)?

[Marco Nenciarini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mnencia/), President and Founding Member of [ITPUG](http://www.itpug.org/index.it.html), a historical member of the [2ndQuadrant](https://www.2ndquadrant.com) team, is present at the event and he thought it was a good idea to present a lightning talk about the PostgreSQL Community and, in particular, about the upcoming events organised by some community groups: [PGDay.IT 2017](http://2017.pgday.it/en7) and [PGConf.EU 2017](https://2017.pgconf.eu/)

Will our hero succeed in attracting the attention of 1,500 pythonistas present at the event?

We'll see! What’s certain is that, thanks to the postponement of the deadline of [Call for Papers of PGDay.IT](http://2017.pgday.it/it/blog/cfp_postponed), new talk suggestions are coming from members of the Python community who are present at EuroPython. Is it possible that we run the risk of having to schedule 3 tracks?

We have a great President!
