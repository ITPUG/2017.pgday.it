to be a Partner of the PGDay.IT 2017. 

This is his answer:

_"20tab has used Postgres in every project since its foundation, in 2012, for private customers, public administration and internal projects._ 

_This choice has always given us great satisfaction and we try to use this tool in its most advanced form, such as its recent implementations for full-text search._ 

_We have always been trying to make our contribution to the community both sharing knowledge and providing economical support."_

Thanks for being part of the PGDay.IT!
