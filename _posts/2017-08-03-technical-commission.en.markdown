<H6> A big thanks to our Technical Commission: Thank you for your great work! </ H6>

It will seems silly to thank the [Technical Commission] (http://2017.pgday.it/it/team/) of [PGDay.IT 2017] (http://2017.pgday.it/en/) for the work done, but we are sure it's necessary because we are aware we gave them a very difficult task.

[As you know](http://2017.pgday.it/en/blog/cfp-closed), 41 talk proposals were sent for [PGDay.IT 2017] (http://2017.pgday.it/en/ and all have interesting technical content.

As organisers, we have decided to offer the best to the participants of [PGDay.IT 2017] (http://2017.pgday.it/en/), so we decided to sacrifice the Recruiting Session. It was a tough decision to make, but the talks received deserved this sacrifice.

The result is that we will have 16 amazing speakers who will present 8 talks in English and 8 talks in Italian.
We couldn't wish for anything better!

Anyone who has seen or is looking at the Schedule already on line, will be wondering: but who will give the Keynote?

We, the organising committee, are working on this and we are sure it will be a great surprise!

We invite everyone to follow us in the next few days, because we'll give more information about the Talks and Speakers that will be present at [PGDay.IT 2017] (http://2017.pgday.it/en/) and you will find out who will give the Keynote. A bit of suspense is necessary, don't you think?

We want to send a warm thanks to each member of our [Technical Commission] (http://2017.pgday.it/en/team/):

* Gabriele Bartolini
* Denis Gasparin
* Torello Querci
* Emanuele Zamprogno

See you in Milan on October 13th!
