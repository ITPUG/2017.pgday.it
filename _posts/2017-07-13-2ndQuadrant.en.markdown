<h5> 2ndQuadrant - one of the historical Partners of PGDay.It</h5>

We are very proud to announce that we have the first Partner of the PGDay.IT: [2ndQuadrant](https://www.2ndquadrant.com)

Historically this company has supported PGDay.IT for many years in its PostgreSQL advocacy path.

Thanks for joining us again!

We asked [Umair Shaid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umair-shahid-9458b327/), 2ndQuadrant's Head of Marketing and Products, for a comment about why he thought
appropriate for 2ndQuadrant to be a Partner of the PGDay.It 2017. This is his answer:

_“2ndQuadrant has always been a strong supporter of the PostgreSQL community across the globe._

_“I find it very exciting that ITPUG is planning to host the event in a different city every year, 
increasing the opportunity for many people to attend.”_

_We expect great things from ITPUG for the future and we are happy to partner with them."_
