<h6>We are very proud to announce that we have a new Partner: Subito</h6>

In 2015, [Subito](https://www.subito.it/) introduced their database architecture based on PostgreSQL, representing one of the most 
interesting use case that will be at PGDay.IT with numbers such as: "[1,500,000 unique visitors, 60,000,000 pages visited per day, 150,000 new ads published](https://twitter.com/_GBartolini_/status/657559069776027648)", 
numbers like these are the best promotion for PostgreSQL. 

hank you very much for joining us!

Inevitably, we can expect a lightning talk from you, right?

We asked [Marco Cupidi](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hello-world-marco-cupidi), CTO in [Subito](https://www.subito.it/), for a comment on why he thought it appropriate to be a Partner of PGDay.IT 2017. 

This is his answer:

_“[Subito](https://www.subito.it/) has made PostgreSQL an indispensable component of its architecture._

_We believe that PGDay is a fundamental meeting to share experiences and keep us update._

_We want to be there and we want to support ITPUG for the valuable work they are carring out.“_
