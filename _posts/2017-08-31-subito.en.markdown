Inevitably, we expect a lightning talk from you, right?

We asked [Marco Cupidi](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hello-world-marco-cupidi), CTO in [Subito](https://www.subito.it/), for a comment about whyhe thought it appropriate for [Subito](https://www.subito.it/) to be a Partner of the PGDay.It 2017. 

This is his answer:

_“Subito has made PostgreSQL an indispensable component of its architecture._

_We believe that PGDay is a fundamental meeting to share experiences and keep us update._

_We want to be there and we want to support ITPUG for the valuable work they are carring out.“_
