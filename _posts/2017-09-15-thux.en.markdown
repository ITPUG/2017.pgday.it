<h6>We are very proud to announce that we have a new Partner: THUX</h6>

Historically, a company connected to the Open Source world and this is the first time that [THUX srl](https://www.thux.it/en/) is a Partner of PGDay.IT

We hope this is just the beginning!

We asked [Ilario Tariello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilario-tariello/), BDM of [THUX](https://www.thux.it/en/), for a comment about why he thought it appropriate for [THUX srl](https://www.thux.it/en/) to become Partner of the PGDay.IT 2017.

Here it is the answer:

_“Because [THUX](https://www.thux.it/en/) develops applications that turn data into value for its customers, by interfacing efficiently and effectively the best data management systems._ 

_THUX has always been using open source software components in its applications, and particularly PostgreSQL._

_In addition, THUX is very active in supporting the open source community, both by being sponsor of events and by providing components like pyMailUP.“_
