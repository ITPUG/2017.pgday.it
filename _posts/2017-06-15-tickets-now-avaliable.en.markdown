Here we are!

Registrations to attend [PGDay.IT 2017](http://2017.pgday.it/) are open. Tickets are available [here](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/pgdayit-2017-tickets-35260542231)

As with the previous editions, we have provided 3 different types of tickets:

* **Early Bird**: **47,00 €** that will no longer be available from September 16th, 2017. From September 16th to October 12th the **Ordinary** tickeys will be available: **95,00 €**.

* **Student**: **15,00 €**. Ticket available until October 12th. Important: A valid student document will be requested at the front desk. In case a valid document demostrating a student status is not presented, the ticket will be canceled without refund.

We cannot rush you to benefit from the [Early Bird](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/pgdayit-2017-tickets-35260542231) since [Call for Paper](http://2017.pgday.it/en/blog/call-for-papers) is still in progress, and we do not have yet a definite schedule for the day. We can assure we have many interesting technical contents proposals, so do not miss this opportunity!

Companies interested in more than 3 tickets are invited to contact us by sending an email to: [pgday@itpug.org](mailto:pgday@itpug.org)

See you in Milan on October 13th, 2017.
