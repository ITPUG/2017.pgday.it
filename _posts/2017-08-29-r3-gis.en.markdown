<h6> We are very proud to announce that we have a new Partner: R3 GIS Srl </h6>

Historically, a company connected to the Open Source world and this is the first time that [R3 GIS Srl](https://www.r3-gis.com/) is a Partner of PGDay.IT

We hope this is is only the beginning!

We asked [Paolo Viskanic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolo-viskanic-6561431/), CEO of R3 GIS, for a comment about why he thought it appropriate for [R3 GIS Srl](https://www.r3-gis.com/) to be a Partner of the PGDay.It 2017. 

This is his answer:

_“Because R3 GIS has always used and promoted open source software components. PostgreSQL and PostGIS are key components of our applications._

_R3 GIS participates to several open source projects._

_Keeping a community alive around open source projects is definitely a great commitment, which must be supported also economically."_
