<h6>We are very excited to announce the opening Keynote for PGDay.IT 2017: Krzysztof Nienartowicz - Gaia</h6>

Thank you for joining us! We look forward to being there!

[Krzysztof](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krzysztof-nienartowicz-6524b0/?ppe=1) is a leader of [Gaia](http://sci.esa.int/gaia/) 
Data Processing Centre in Geneva which is part of European Space Agency Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium.

His journey with increasingly challenging projects started at the end of his studies where he had a chance to work around biggest 
econometric time series data at the time in the US, UK and Poland (1996). 

Attracted by the biggest world scientific-database then, he joined Database group at [CERN](https://home.cern/) in Geneva (2001) where he was co-author of 
the largest data migration, producing the largest scientific relation database that had been running at [CERN](https://home.cern/). 

After joining Gaia group in Geneva as data architect (2008), he has been responsible for all aspects of the platform to derive useful 
scientific results from one of the most data-demanding [ESA](http://www.esa.int/ESA) projects. 

**Keynote abstract**

[Gaia](http://sci.esa.int/gaia/) is a cornerstone [ESA](http://www.esa.int/ESA) space mission to craft the most precise three-dimensional map of our Galaxy for 
decades to come. 

The talk will describe how the [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and its ecosystem enabled large-scale with Variability Studies at [Gaia](http://sci.esa.int/gaia/) 
Data processing Centre in Geneva in the context a new wave of cutting-edge astronomical missions producing petabyte-scale results. 

Ideas behind data model, iterative process, international collaboration while dealing with multibillion-sized sets will be outlined as 
well as architectural challenges and choices.

I will also give insight on our experience with [Postgres-XL](https://www.postgres-xl.org/), scalable Postgres incarnation that we have been supporting 
from its inception and how the perseverance pays off.
