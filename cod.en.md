All delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers of PGDay.IT must
follow the following code of conduct.
Organizers will enforce this code before and throughout the event.

##### In short

PGDay.IT wants to provide an experience of the conference without harassment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment to conference participants in any form.
Language and sexual images are not appropriate for any area of
conference, including presentations.
Conference participants who violate these rules can be fined
or expelled from the conference without refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

##### Long version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, chasing, photographs or
harassing recordings, continued interruption of presentations or other events,
inappropriate physical contact and unwanted sexual attention.

Participants who are instructed to stop any harassing behavior are
required to comply immediately.

Even the exhibitors in the exhibition hall, in banquets for sponsors or suppliers,
or similar activities are subject to standard anti harassment.
In particular, the exhibitors must not use sexualized images or other material.
The staff of the banquets (including volunteers) should not use
sexualized clothing / uniforms / costumes, or otherwise create a
sexualized environment.

If a participant undertakes a harassing behavior, the conference organizers
may take any measures they find appropriate, including
the expulsion from the conference without any reimbursement.

If you get harassed, or you see someone else being harassed,
or you have any other concern,
please contact immediately a member of the Conference staff,
identified by blue shirt on.

The conference staff will help participants to contact the Safety
team of the location or the local law enforcement,
to escort, or assist in other ways those experiencing harassment.

These rules also extend to social events linked to the conference.
